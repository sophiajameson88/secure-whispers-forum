## Deployment Instructions

1. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContract
   VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
   ```

2. **Deploy smart contract** to Sepolia testnet

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy automatically

## Security Considerations
